/**
 * Contains domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) for the Discogs
 * Query application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes classes that represent the core data structures used
 * throughout the application.
 * It encompasses:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Domain models that capture the essential data entities for the
 *     application.</li>
 *     <li>Classes that define the structure and format of data as received
 *     from or sent to external APIs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package are designed to encapsulate and manage data
 * relevant to the Discogs API interactions,
 * including the representation of API responses, query results, and other
 * related information.
 * These classes often use Lombok annotations for automatic generation of
 * boilerplate code such as getters, setters,
 * builders, and constructors.
