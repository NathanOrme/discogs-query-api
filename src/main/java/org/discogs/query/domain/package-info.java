/**
 * Contains domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs) for the Discogs Query application.
 *
 * <p>This package includes classes that represent the core data structures used throughout the
 * application. It encompasses:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Domain models that capture the essential data entities for the application.
 *   <li>Classes that define the structure and format of data as received from or sent to external
 *       APIs.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The classes in this package are designed to encapsulate and manage data relevant to the
 * Discogs API interactions, including the representation of API responses, query results, and other
 * related information. These classes often use Lombok annotations for automatic generation of
 * boilerplate code such as getters, setters, builders, and constructors.
