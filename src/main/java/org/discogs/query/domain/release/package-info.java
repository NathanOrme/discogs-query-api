 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These classes are primarily used to map the structure
 * of a music release as stored in the Discogs database,
 * facilitating the retrieval and manipulation of release information.
 * <p>
 * The package is designed to work with JSON
 * serialization/deserialization libraries such as Jackson,
