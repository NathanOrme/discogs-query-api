/**
 * Contains custom exception classes for handling errors in the Discogs Query
 * application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes exceptions specifically
 * designed to handle and represent error conditions
 * that may occur within the application. It provides:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Custom exception classes that extend
 *     {@link java.lang.RuntimeException} or other base exception types.</li>
 *     <li>Exception handling tailored to the application's
 *     specific needs, such as errors related to API interactions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * By defining custom exceptions, this package
 * helps to clearly represent and manage error conditions,
 * enabling better error reporting, handling, and debugging.
 * Custom exceptions provide meaningful error messages
 * and can encapsulate additional information about the errors encountered.
