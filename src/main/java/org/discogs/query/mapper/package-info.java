/**
 * Contains mapper classes for converting between domain models, data transfer objects (DTOs), and external API responses.
 * <p>
 * This package includes classes responsible for mapping data between different representations used in the application.
 * It includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Mapper classes that convert between API response formats and internal domain models or DTOs.</li>
 *     <li>Utilities for transforming and adapting data as it flows between different layers of the application.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The mapper classes help ensure that data is correctly and efficiently transformed from one format to another,
 * improving data consistency and reducing the risk of errors during data conversion. This separation of concerns
 * supports a clean architecture by decoupling data representation from business logic.
