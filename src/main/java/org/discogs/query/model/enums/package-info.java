/**
 * Contains enumeration types used throughout the Discogs Query application.
 *
 * <p>This package includes enums that define fixed sets of constants used for various purposes
 * within the application. It includes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Enumerations for different query parameters and their values when interacting with the
 *       Discogs API.
 *   <li>Enumerations for supported formats, currencies, and types relevant to the application's
 *       domain logic.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The enums in this package help standardize and manage predefined values used across the
 * application, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors. They provide a way to work
 * with a fixed set of constants in a type-safe manner, improving code readability and
 * maintainability.
