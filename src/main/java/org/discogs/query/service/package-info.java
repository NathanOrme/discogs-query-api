/**
 * Contains service classes for handling business logic and interactions with external systems in the Discogs Query application.
 * <p>
 * This package includes service classes that encapsulate the core business logic and provide methods for interacting
 * with external systems, such as APIs, and processing data within the application. It includes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Services for querying and processing data from the Discogs API.</li>
 *     <li>Business logic for managing and transforming data related to Discogs queries and results.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The service classes in this package act as intermediaries between the application's controllers and data access layers,
 * ensuring that business rules are applied, and interactions with external systems are managed effectively. This separation
 * of concerns supports a clean architecture and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application.
